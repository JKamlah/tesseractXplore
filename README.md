# iNaturalist Image Tagger
A CLI tool to add iNaturalist taxonomy metadata to local observation photos.

## Use Cases
The purpose of this is to take some of the useful information from your own observations and
embed it in your local photo collection.

### Metadata for other biodiversity tools
This can improve interoperability with other tools and systems that interact with biodiversity
data. For example, in addition to iNaturalist you may submit observations of certain species to
another biodiversity observation platform with a more specific focus, such as eBird, BugGuide, or
Mushroom Observer. For that use case, this tool supports
[Simple Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/simple).

### Metadata for photo sharing
This can also simplify tagging photos for photo hosting sites like Flickr. For that use case, this
tool generates keywords in the same format as
[iNaturalist's Flickr Tagger](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/flickr_tagger).

### Metadata for local organization
Finally, this can enable you to search and filter your local photo collection by type of organism
like you can in the iNaturalist web UI or mobile apps. For that use case, a photo viewer or DAM
that supports **hierarchical keywords** is recommended, such as Lightroom,
[FastPictureViewer](https://www.fastpictureviewer.com), or
[XnViewMP](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp).

## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/JWCook/inat-image-tagger.git
```

## Usage

```
Usage: nt [OPTIONS] [IMAGES]...

  Get taxonomy tags from an iNaturalist observation or taxon, and write them
  to local image metadata.

  Keywords Only:
  If no images are specified, this command will just print the generated keywords.

  Keywords:
  Keywords will be generated in the format taxonomy:{rank}={name}.

  Hierarchical Keywords:
  If specified, hierarchical keywords will be generated

  DarwinCore:
  If an observation is specified, DwC metadata will also be generated, in the form of
  XMP tags. Among other things, this includes taxonomy tags in the format
  dwc:{rank}="{name}".

  Sidecar Files:
  By default, XMP tags will be written to a sidecar file if it already exists.
  Use the -x / --create-xmp option to create a new one if it doesn't exist.

Options:
  -c, --common-names      Include common names for all ranks that have them
  -h, --hierarchical      Generate pipe-delimited hierarchical keywords
  -o, --observation TEXT  Observation ID or URL
  -t, --taxon TEXT        Taxon ID or URL
  -x, --create-xmp        Create XMP sidecar file if it doesn't already exist
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```

## Examples

Just generate keywords from a taxon:
```bash
naturtag -ct 48978
Fetching taxon 48978
12 parent taxa found
22 keywords generated

taxonomy:kingdom=Animalia
taxonomy:phylum=Mollusca
taxonomy:class=Gastropoda
taxonomy:subclass=Heterobranchia
taxonomy:infraclass=Euthyneura
taxonomy:subterclass=Ringipleura
taxonomy:superorder=Nudipleura
taxonomy:order=Nudibranchia
taxonomy:suborder=Cladobranchia
taxonomy:superfamily=Proctonotoidea
taxonomy:family=Dironidae
taxonomy:genus=Dirona
"taxonomy:species=Dirona picta"
Animals
Molluscs
Gastropods
"Heterobranch Gastropods"
"Euthyneuran Gastropods"
"Nudipleuran Slugs"
Nudibranchs
"Colorful Dirona"
inat:taxon_id=48978
```

Generate both keywords and DarwinCore metadata for an observation, and write to two images and an XMP sidecar:
```
$ naturtag -co 45524803 img00001.jpg img00002.jpg
Fetching observation 45524803
Fetching taxon 48978
12 parent taxa found
23 keywords generated
Getting darwincore terms for observation 45524803
Writing 39 tags to img00001.jpg
Writing 37 tags to img00001.xmp
Writing 39 tags to img00002.jpg
No existing XMP sidecar file found for img00002.jpg; skipping
```
[See example of XMP metadata generated by this command](./examples/45524803.xmp).

## Development Status
At the moment this is just an experimental hobby project, and not very polished. The basic
features described below are functional, though. I plan to work on this long enough to prove
whether or not the concept will actually be useful as part of a naturalist/photographer's
workflow; if so, there is a long list of features I'd like to continue adding onto this.
For example:

## TODO
Future feature ideas:
* Tests, docs, publish on pypi, etc.
* Auto-tag mode: scan for images with existing tags (like taxon ID or name), and fill in all
  missing info
* Options to fetch keywords from Flickr and other sources
* Support for annotations (life stage, phenology, etc.) and observation fields
* Taxon text search in CLI with tab-completion
* Advanced batch processing
* Local caching for faster lookups
* ASCII art-based image previews (only joking. maybe.)
